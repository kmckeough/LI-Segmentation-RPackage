\title{Calculate Posterior Ratio}
\usage{
ratioCalc(log1, log2)
}
\arguments{
\item{log1}{the log posterior componants for pixel assignments 1}

\item{log2}{the log powerior componants for pixel assignments 2}
}
\value{
the weights and exponant components of the ratio
}
\description{
The final ratio between the posteriors of pixel assignments 1 and pixel
assignments 2. If the ratio is greater than1, than pixel assignment 1 is more
likely than pixel assingment 2.
